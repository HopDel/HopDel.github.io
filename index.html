          <p class="text-white-80"> Animal Instict is a 5 day event based on discovering activities that bring joy without regard of a momentaliry discomfort. All these types of activities will be present on the event - from guided cold water dive, movement training, hiking or running, music, games, campfires and others. The event is held in mountain range in Czechia and its purpose is to broaden your horizons, push your limits and allow you to discover and connect with yourself.

		  <blockquote class = "otro-blockquote text-white-80"><p>After 12 years of experience with organising sport-events / camps in a small village of "Miroslav" in Czech Republic, I decided to develop this thought of adventure for a wider circle of people.</p>

		  <p>We started two years ago with a few friends and created this event for Czech people. We tried to share our accumulated energy and life experience in only five days with everybody who would like to work on themselves and have fun at the same time. We would like to connect with people who have the same enthusiasm into bigger group. We want you to work hard, laugh from your heart, think and be united with nature. </p>

I liked to work with my own body and the space I had for my mind and the innerself. Specially the stimuluses I had for them. Your attitude and attitude of all people was great. Usually I have lot of remarks but I do not have them now. Only negative is distance for me but the place was beautiful and the owners were amazing. I really do not have anything to say. Just amazing event and thank you for that."</p>

                 <p>"Thank you so so much for everything you prepared for us as participants. Just now when I am thinking about Instinct and all the great people I have smile on my face and tear in my eye that it ended and I will have to wait all long year. I enjoyed it so much and experienced remarkable moments, have learned a lot of new things, met new people and specially recharged a lot of positive energy from I which still draw.
				I rested mentally a lot though the body was really tired. I think it was exactly what I need to break away from thoughts about work and useless thoughts.
				I found myself few times that when I was thinking about my physical health condition (I know it can be always worse) that I was down in the dumps. I hope it was not so obvious because through the positive energy of all people it faded out really fast and I could enjoy moments of peace and harmony. Unless we did not train:-D... Hard training, team games, moments of rest and relax and posibility of self education in our free time - the whole concept is just perfect. You are amazing how you can handle everything despite all obstacles that will get in your way and nobody can see that. Thanks to you I am not giving up, trying to think positive and even if it is sometimes not easy I have to deal with that and continue.
				One more time "Thank you so much"."</p>

                 <p>"First of all I want to thank you for the wonderful experience I will remember all my life. Everything was very "Yours". You were "printed" in each activity. Actually I do not have anything more to add. If "feedback" means list of suggestions and feelings about something we have experience with then I think my amazing feeling comes from your authenticity. You do it in your way. I do not know anything like this. I believe that your success will not be depend on what somebody tells you but that you will keep doing it in your way with same enthusiasm and originally. Continue with this next year. Continue with similar activities. You have it in yourself. My overall impression since we said goodbye have not changed. Even though I am physically o tired (I know it is relative), I am mentally rested. After return the well known feeling appeared: "I am happy that I was part of it. I will always look back at these memories with smile." Strongest moments (ehm... moments... parts of flowing time I am grateful for): TRIM, running slope, sunrise, ice bath, Honza's story about transmission, Olda's free-time, sharing feeling and sitting by fire, final training and end of all: Your incredible energy. When you were able to smile, being nice and having fun during huge physical tiredness. Hope you will forgive me. I do not want to describe details. You know it well. And if somebody read this I would not want to deprive him of surprise and that (if he/she will decide to be part of it) will come this free state of mind when you do not create any expectations about programme but you just flow with it (maybe that is the reason why I was so relaxed)."</p>
